<p><strong>The app this website was hosted on Heroku became a paid service. We refused to pay so they took it down without mercy. I will try and explain it here in full detail</strong></p>
<h3>FarmBnB is an AirBnB clone but instead of renting rooms, you can rent... <strong>Farm Animals!</strong></h3>

<p>After booking, you can check the Booking page to see the current status of the animal wheter it is pending, rejected or accepted.</p>
<p>If the border color is Orange - it means pending, Red - Rejected, Green - Accepted.
